## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

With this challenge I learned to use grid and how to be efficient with grid css. I learned how to avoid using !important and some element position details.

### Continued development

I want to be more effecti with mobile menus, I feel it a bit clunky still, so with practive I hope to give it a better structure and make a more efficient code.
